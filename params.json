Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Simple page to show me time in another city","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
